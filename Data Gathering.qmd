# Data Collection

## Record Data

The recod data I collected are mainly from NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NHTSA have publications that contains many data that is quite useful for this research. However, some data are available in differnt kinds besides csv. So it will take quite a time to clean

### Gender
Now the raw data looks like this,
![Raw Data Gender](images/Raw%20data%20gender.jpg)
It's quite messy on the top. So, I will need to clean the column names to make it tidy. 

After cleaning process, the data now looks like this, 
![Cleaned Data Gender](images/Cleaned%20Data%20gender.jpg)

Note this is not enough, I still need to further tidy the column names to make it better

### Young Driver

The data available about young driver information is mainly from NHTSA, and it's in PDF format, so I will need to first download the data, scrape them into csv file, and then do more analysis.


## Text Data 

There are also some text data available that I use API to pull them from the webiste. I will further clean them and also put them onto the page.

So right now I will need to sort the text out, like find out the publisher of the paper, the title, the description, etc.
