# Data Collection

## Record Data

The recod data I collected are mainly from NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NHTSA have publications that contains many data that is quite useful for this research. However, some data are available in differnt kinds besides csv. So it will take quite a time to clean

### Gender
The dataset is used to analyze possible gender effects on fatal accidents rate. This dataset will be joined by other datasets together to be analyzed

### Accident

This data file contains information about crash characteristics and environmental conditions at the time of the crash. There is one record per crash.

### Crash Event

This data file contains information for all of the qualifying events (i.e., both harmful and non-harmful) that occurred in the crash. It details the chronological sequence of events resulting from an unstabilized situation that constitutes a motor vehicle traffic crash. There is one record per event. Included in each record is a description of the event or object contacted (e.g., ran off road-right, crossed center line, guardrail, parked motor vehicle), the vehicles involved, and the vehicles' areas of impact.

## Text Data 

There are also some text data available that I use API to pull them from the webiste. I will further clean them and also put them onto the page.

So right now I will need to sort the text out, like find out the publisher of the paper, the title, the description, etc.
