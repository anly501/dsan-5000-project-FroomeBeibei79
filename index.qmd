# What I like

## Sports
I love to bike, and watch Formula 1 during the weekend. Sometimes I also play the simulator on PC just to have fun, and experience the Formula 1 in a more intuitive way

## Things in Life
I like cars, A LOT. I love everything from the design of the car, the engine, transmission of the car, to the difference on configration of the car due to the different law and environmental requirments in different countries. I also have a very strong interest on analyzing anything data-related to the car. I have done a project before, which focuses on analyzing lap time driven by myself in game F1 22. Now I have switched tracks to collect data from real-world, and to see if the data can inspire me in some ways!


## Foods!
I love trying new foods in every places around the world. I also very much engaged with trying to re-make the same food at home. Ramen, steak, burrito, everything!
Below are something I have tried to cook at home, and it was very good at the end!

## This is a hilarious quote from Jeremy Clarkson
> Speed has never killed anyone, suddenly becoming stationaryâ€¦ That's what gets you -- Jeremy Clarkson







### Some Requirements

This is an inline math equation: <span style="font-size: 120%;">
$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$</span>.


The area of a circle with radius \(r\) is given by the formula:

$$
[A = \pi r^2]
$$

Where:

- \(A\) is the area of the circle.
  
- (pi) is approximately 3.14159.
  
- \(r\) is the radius of the circle.



```{mermaid}
graph LR;
  A[A4, A5] --> B(S4, S5);
  B --> C(RS4, RS5);

```



This approach enables you to use the same bibliography with different citation
styles without having to change anything about your document or the bibliography itself apart from the bibliography style when your paper is finally compiled
for print.
