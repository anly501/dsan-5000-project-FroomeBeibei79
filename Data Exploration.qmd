# Explore

In this page we will explore the data in various kinds of ways to see what might catch out eyes

## 1.1 Data Understanding: 

Begin by thoroughly understanding the dataset and the problem you are trying to solve. Familiarize yourself with the characteristics of each feature, including their data types (numerical, categorical), potential relationships, and relevance to the project’s objectives.


## 1.2 Descriptive Statistics: 
 
Calculate and report basic summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance for numerical variables. For categorical variables, provide frequency distributions and bar charts to visualize data distribution.

## 1.3 Data Visualization: 

Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore the data’s distribution, relationships between variables, and potential patterns or trends. Visualizations can make complex data more interpretable.

## 1.4 Correlation Analysis: 

Examine the correlations between variables using correlation matrices, heat-maps, or scatter plots. Identify which variables are positively, negatively, or not correlated, which can guide further analysis.

## 1.5 Hypothesis Generation: 

Based on your initial observations from the data, refine your hypotheses and research questions.

## 1.6 Data Grouping and Segmentation: 

If applicable, group or segment the data based on relevant criteria to uncover insights within specific subgroups.

## 1.7 Identifying Outliers: 

Detect and investigate outliers that may indicate data quality issues or reveal interesting anomalies in the dataset.

## 1.8 Report and discuss your methods and findings: 

Summarize the key findings, insights, and patterns discovered during the EDA phase. Present these findings in a clear and organized manner, using textual narration, tables, charts, and narrative descriptions.

## 1.9 Tools and Software: 

Mention and discuss the software tools you will use for EDA, such as Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, or R with ggplot2, depending on your preference and project requirements.
