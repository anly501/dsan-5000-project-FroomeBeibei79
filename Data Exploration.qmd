# Explore

In this page we will explore the data in various kinds of ways to see what might catch out eyes

## 1.1 Data Understanding: 

The data I have here is the accident summary conducted by the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS); FARS is a nationwide census providing NHTSA, Congress and the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes. This data contains very detailed information that records the condition of each accident.

The data was separated into different files, which can be joined together by a universal column, case number. So we can combine different files to get different information.

## 1.2 Descriptive Statistics: 
 
Some basic summary statistics are mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and variance. Among all these descriptive statistics, the only meaningful column is time, specifically, hour. That is when the accident happened during the day.
![Descriptive Statistics](images/EDA%20Descriptive%20Stat.jpg) 

## 1.3 Data Visualization: 

There are a couple of visulaized plots help us to see intuitivalely 

### Distribution by State

Below the plot provides an overview of accident summaries distributed by state, allowing us to identify the states with the highest and lowest accident counts.
![distribution by state](images/EDA%20crash%20distribution%20of%20state.png)

From the chart, we can observe that the distribution is not uniform across states. Some states have a significantly higher number of entries compared to others. This could be due to various factors such as population, geographical size, traffic volume, or data collection methods.

### Distrbution by Weekday

This plot reveals the days of the week that are most likely to experience fatal crashes
![distribution by weekday](images/EDA%20crash%20distribution%20of%20day.png)

The distribution of entries is relatively uniform across the days of the week.
There seems to be a slight increase in entries on Saturdays and Sundays.
This could suggest a potential increase in incidents or events during the weekends, but further analysis would be needed to confirm any such trends and to understand their causes.

### Distribution by Direction
This plot illustrates the direction in which a vehicle is most likely to experience an accident
![distribution by direction](images/EDA%20crash%20distribution%20of%20direction.png)

From this chart, we can observe that:
"Non-Harmful Event" and "12 Clock Point" are the most common areas of impact recorded in the dataset.
There are various other areas of impact with fewer occurrences.
This information could be useful for understanding the common types of impacts and their frequencies, which might help in identifying areas for safety improvements.

## 1.4 Correlation Analysis: 

In the Correlation Analysis step, we will:

1. Calculate the correlation matrix for the numerical variables in the dataset.
2. Visualize the correlations using a heatmap.

### Raw correlation

Let's start by calculating the correlation matrix.
![Raw correlation](images/EDA%20Correlation%20Raw.jpg)

As we can see from the matrix, STATE_x and ST_CASE have a very high positive correlation (almost 1), which is expected as the case number (ST_CASE) is likely assigned sequentially within each state.

HOUR and MINUTE have a positive correlation of 0.2644, indicating a moderate relationship.

EVENTNUM and VNUMBER1 also have a strong positive correlation of 0.8227, suggesting a strong relationship between these two variables.

AOI1 and SOE have a positive correlation of 0.5630, indicating a moderate to strong relationship.

### Correlation heatmap

Next, we will visualize these correlations using a heatmap to make it easier to interpret the relationships between variables.
![Correlation Heatmap](images/EDA%20heatmap%20correlation.png)


The heatmap above visualizes the correlation matrix, providing a color-coded representation of the correlation coefficients between each pair of numerical variables.

From the heatmap, we can easily identify strong positive correlations (dark red areas) and observe the relationships between different variables. For example, the strong positive correlation between "EVENTNUM" and "VNUMBER1" is clearly visible.

### Correlation between day of the week and hour of the day

To investigate the relationship between the day of the week and the hour of the day, we can create a heatmap that displays the count of entries for each combination of day and hour. This will help us visualize if there are certain times of the day that are more prone to incidents on specific weekdays
![Heatmap correlation](images/EDA%20heatmap%20time%20and%20day.png)

From this visualization, we can observe that:

The hours with the most entries tend to be in the afternoon and evening, particularly from around 14:00 to 18:00. This could be due to increased traffic during these hours.

There are fewer entries during the early morning hours, which is expected since there is typically less traffic at that time.

Saturday and Sunday show a slightly different pattern compared to the weekdays, with more entries occurring late at night and in the early morning hours. This could be indicative of different driving behaviors during the weekends, potentially related to social activities.

The column labeled "Unknown" represents entries where the hour was not recorded or was unknown. These entries are spread across all days of the week.

## 1.5 Hypothesis Generation: 

Based on the exploratory data analysis we've conducted so far, here are some potential hypotheses and questions:

### Time of Day and Incidents:

Hypothesis: There are more incidents in the afternoon and evening compared to other times of the day.
Potential Analysis: Investigate if certain types of incidents are more likely to occur during these times.

### Weekend Driving Behavior:

Hypothesis: Driving behavior during the weekends, especially late at night and in the early morning hours, leads to more incidents.

Potential Analysis: Examine the types of incidents that occur during these times and if they are different from weekday incidents.

### State-wise Distribution:

Question: Why do some states have significantly more incidents recorded in the dataset? Is it due to population, traffic volume, or data collection methods?

Potential Analysis: Normalize the data by population or traffic volume to better understand the state-wise distribution.

### Impact Areas:

Hypothesis: Certain areas of impact, such as the "Non-Harmful Event" and "12 Clock Point", are more common.

Potential Analysis: Investigate the circumstances that lead to these common impact areas.

### Sequence of Events:

Hypothesis: The "Motor Vehicle In-Transport" event is the most common sequence of events leading to incidents.

Potential Analysis: Explore what specific situations or factors contribute to this sequence of events.

## 1.6 Data Grouping and Segmentation: 

If applicable, group or segment the data based on relevant criteria to uncover insights within specific subgroups.

### Group by States
![Group by States](images/EDA%20Group%20States.png)
The data grouped by state shows the total number of entries (incidents) for each state:

1. California and Texas have the highest number of entries, with 11,952 and 11,787 incidents respectively.
2. States like Alaska, District of Columbia, and Rhode Island have the lowest number of entries, all below 150 incidents.
3. This distribution could be influenced by various factors such as population, geographical size, traffic volume, and data collection methods.

### Group by time of the day
![Group by Day](images/EDA%20Group%20Day.png)
From this distribution, we can observe that:

1. The number of incidents is higher in the evening, followed by the afternoon and night.
2. The morning has the lowest number of incidents.
3. There are a significant number of incidents during the night, which could be worth investigating further, especially given the reduced traffic volumes during these hours.

## 1.7 Identifying Outliers: 

To identify outliers, we can use various methods such as:

1. Z-Scores: Calculate the Z-score of each data point and identify points with a Z-score beyond a certain threshold (e.g., |Z| > 3).
2. IQR Method: Calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR) and identify points beyond 1.5 * IQR from the quartiles.
3. Visualizations: Use box plots to visually identify outliers.

Since we have multiple numerical variables in our dataset, we will start by using box plots to visually identify outliers in these variables.
![Box Plots](images/EDA%20box%20plot.png)

From the box plots, we can observe that:

1. STATE_x: There are no visible outliers.
2. ST_CASE: This is a case number, and it doesn’t have outliers in the traditional sense
3. DAY: There are no visible outliers.
4. HOUR: There are values set to 99, which likely represent unknown or missing values rather than outliers.
5. MINUTE: Similar to "HOUR", there are values set to 99.
6. EVENTNUM, VNUMBER1, AOI1, SOE: These variables have a significant number of high values that could be considered outliers. However, without more context on what these numbers represent, it’s challenging to definitively label them as outliers.

To properly handle the potential outliers, we would need additional context on the data and the variables, especially for the ones with coded values (EVENTNUM, VNUMBER1, AOI1, SOE).
