# Project Proposal

This tab aims to find out which factors could have a strong influence on fatal crashes. Does it have connections with drinking and drugs? Is it positively related to sex or age?

On this page, we will discover two ways of doing dimensionality reduction. One is PCA, Principal Component Analysis, the other is t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). These techniques are applied to a dataset to understand their effectiveness in data visualization and pattern recognition.

The data I used is the fatal accidents that happened in America in 2020. It contains detailed information about every accident police recorded, and we will this time focus on the people side, to see which factors have the most impact on driver behavior and lead to fatal crashes.

Packages used in this project:
1. Scikit-Learn: For implementing PCA and t-SNE algorithms. This library offers efficient and easy-to-use tools for data analysis and machine learning.
2. Matplotlib: For data visualization, creating plots to visually compare the results obtained from PCA and t-SNE.
3. NumPy: For numerical computations, which might be necessary for data preprocessing or additional analysis.
4. Pandas: For data manipulation and extraction, especially useful if the dataset is in a tabular format.


## PCA

Before we proceed, we first rough clean the data, remove any non-human factors.

```{.python .hide}
merge_df = pd.merge(accident_df, person_df, on = "ST_CASE", how = 'inner')

columns_to_keep = [
    # Driver-Specific Information
    'AGE', 'SEX', 'DRINKING', 'DRUGS', 'ALC_DET', 'ALC_STATUS', 
    'DRUG_DET', 'DSTATUS', 'INJ_SEV', 'PER_TYP', 'DAY_WEEK', 'HOUR_x', 'WEATHER', 'LGT_COND','STATE_x'
]

# Keeping only the selected columns and dropping the rest
merge_df = merge_df[columns_to_keep]
```

Now let's proceed.

Using PCA, we are able to get a plot which is the cumulative explained variance by PCA Components.

So we select the first two components, and let's see if we can get some information from these two

![PCA components](images/PCA%202%20PC.png)

There is no clear clustering of points, which suggests that there may not be distinct groups within the data based on these two principal components alone.

Let's try biplot to see what kinds of result will we get

Alright! Based on this plot, Variables like Drinking, drugs, and drug detection, are pointing in a similar way, this suggests that they are positively correlated with each other and contribute similarly to these components. Based on their direction, these factors have more influence on PC 1 than it has on PC 2.

Sex and age are similar to drugs and drinking but with less influence than those components.

ALC_STATUS has a strong loading on PC2 and some level of loading on PC1, indicating that this variable significantly differentiates the data along PC 2. Injury severity has a notable contribution to both PC1 and PC2, but more on PC2. This might be interpreted as injury severity varying along with alcohol status but also related to the other factors that align with PC1.

The variables associated with substance use (DRINKING, DRUGS, DRUG_DET, ALC_STATUS) are significant in explaining the variance in the data. This suggests that substance use is a major factor in the nature and severity of crashes. So, no drugs, no drinking if you are going to drive.

The positioning of INJ_SEV could indicate that crashes involving substance use or certain demographics (SEX) may result in different injury severities. Other variables like WEATHER, LGT_COND (light conditions), and HOUR have smaller angles with each other, suggesting they are somewhat correlated and may jointly influence the conditions under which accidents occur.



# t-SNE

Let's proceed to t-SNE to see

![TSNE](images/TSNE%20plot.png)

Compared to PCA, t-SNE us better at capturing the local structure of the data and can reveal clusters that might not be visible in PCA. PCA shows the overall structure and explains the variance in the data using fewer components, but might not reveal clusters as effectively as t-SNE.


# Conclusion and Result Analysis

When working with these two different methods, I can tell that the PCA is much faster when it comes to generating plots in a global data structure scale. t-SNE, on the other hand, is better at identifying clusters and local patterns in high-dimensional data. And for my dataset, the visualization is very sensitive to parameter settings.

PCA is effective at preserving global structure and linear relationships in the data. It's good at capturing the directions in which the data varies the most, while t-SNE is excellent at preserving local structures and revealing clusters in the data.

Overall, PCA is fast, scalable to large datasets, and provides a clear rank ordering of dimensions. However, it's less effective for non-linear data. t-SNE is highly effective in revealing local structures and clusters, but it is computationally intensive, and cannot be scaled up to large datasets, like this one I'm working on, it even took 10 minutes to get results, and sometimes it's inconsistent.
