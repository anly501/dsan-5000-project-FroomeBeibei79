Familiarize yourself with the characteristics of each feature, including their data types (numerical, categorical), potential relationships, and relevance to the project’s objectives.\n\n\n\nCalculate and report basic summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance for numerical variables. For categorical variables, provide frequency distributions and bar charts to visualize data distribution.\n\n\n\nCreate visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore the data’s distribution, relationships between variables, and potential patterns or trends. Visualizations can make complex data more interpretable.\n\n\n\nExamine the correlations between variables using correlation matrices, heat-maps, or scatter plots. Identify which variables are positively, negatively, or not correlated, which can guide further analysis.\n\n\n\nBased on your initial observations from the data, refine your hypotheses and research questions.\n\n\n\nIf applicable, group or segment the data based on relevant criteria to uncover insights within specific subgroups.\n\n\n\nDetect and investigate outliers that may indicate data quality issues or reveal interesting anomalies in the dataset.\n\n\n\nSummarize the key findings, insights, and patterns discovered during the EDA phase. Present these findings in a clear and organized manner, using textual narration, tables, charts, and narrative descriptions.\n\n\n\nMention and discuss the software tools you will use for EDA, such as Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, or R with ggplot2, depending on your preference and project requirements."
