    "text": "Written by Xingrui Huo Froome\nGU ID: xh231\n\n\nAs I moved to a new place for grad school, my car moved with me and so does the car insurance. However, as I requested for the new quote, I found out that the price went higher than expected. So I changed my insurance company and during the conversation with the new insurance company. I found out that there is one discount that can be added to my policy if I agree to let the insurance company to send me a device and put it in my vehicle to record my daily drive data.\nI found that very interesting because the insurance staff told me that as I driving, the device will record data and send it back to the insurance company. As to every end of policy, I will receive discount based on my driving records.\nI start to become interested about this little device. How does it record the data? What kind of data does it record? What kind of result can it get based on the data it records? I feel like that I can do the same thing, collect the same data, and do some similar analysis on myself. So I can do driver behavior analysis on myself. Of course, the most important thing in here is, how to do driver behavior analysis?\nBelow are two academic sources and some questions to start with:\n\n\n\n(Kaplan et al. 2015)\nThis is a link to source\n\n\nDriver drowsiness and distraction are two main reasons for traffic accidents and the related financial losses. Therefore, researchers have been working for more than a decade on designing driver inattention monitoring systems. As a result, several detection techniques for the detection of both drowsiness and distraction have been proposed in the literature. Some of these techniques were successfully adopted and implemented by the leading car companies. This paper discusses and provides a comprehensive insight into the well-established techniques for driver inattention monitoring and introduces the use of most recent and futuristic solutions exploiting mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable devices. Then, a proposal is made for the active of such systems into car-to-car communication to support vehicular ad hoc network’s (VANET’s) primary aim of safe driving. We call this approach the dissemination of driver behavior via C2C communication. Throughout this paper, the most remarkable studies of the last five years were examined thoroughly in order to reveal the recent driver monitoring techniques and demonstrate the basic pros and cons. In addition, the studies were categorized into two groups: driver drowsiness and distraction. Then, research on the driver drowsiness was further divided into two main subgroups based on the exploitation of either visual features or nonvisual features. A comprehensive compilation, including used features, classification methods, accuracy rates, system parameters, and environmental details, was represented as tables to highlight the (dis)advantages and/or limitations of the aforementioned categories. A similar approach was also taken for the methods used for the detection of driver distraction.\n\n\n\nthe literature review highlighted the need for combining techniques, the importance of alerting mechanisms, and the potential of C2C communication for improving driver safety. Despite limitations, ongoing advancements indicate a promising future for driver monitoring and assistance systems.\n\n\n\n\n(Chan et al. 2019)\nThis is a link to source\n\n\nHuman factors are the primary catalyst for traffic accidents. Among different factors, fatigue, distraction, drunkenness, and/or recklessness are the most common types of abnormal driving behavior that leads to an accident. With technological advances, modern smartphones have the capabilities for driving behavior analysis. There has not yet been a comprehensive review on methodologies utilizing only a smartphone for drowsiness detection and abnormal driver behavior detection. In this paper, different methodologies proposed by different authors are discussed. It includes the sensing schemes, detection algorithms, and their corresponding accuracy and limitations. Challenges and possible solutions such as integration of the smartphone behavior classification system with the concept of context-aware, mobile crowdsensing, and active steering control are analyzed. The issue of model training and updating on the smartphone and cloud environment is also included.\n\n\n\nThe paper discusses the use of smartphone data as a valuable resource for analyzing driver behavior. It reviews various methodologies proposed by different authors for detecting abnormal driving patterns. While smartphone-based systems offer advantages over telematics boxes, there are significant challenges to consider for accurate driver behavior classification.\nKey challenges include the impact of varying light conditions on vision-based methodologies and the need to eliminate noise and external factors in sensor-based approaches, such as road conditions and vehicle components. Future research should address these issues. Additionally, eliminating the requirement for mounting the smartphone in a fixed position would enhance flexibility and convenience for drivers.\nThe paper also explores potential solutions, such as integrating smartphone-based driver behavior analysis with context-awareness, crowdsensing, and steering control, as well as mobile or cloud-based algorithm training and updates. While these solutions may not be perfect, they have the potential to address some of the challenges, suggesting that there is room for further improvement in smartphone-based behavior analysis systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can we accurately measure and quantify aggressive driving behavior using telematics data?\nWhat are the most effective strategies for detecting and reducing instances of distracted driving?\nCan machine learning algorithms predict the likelihood of a driver engaging in risky behaviors based on historical data?\nHow does driver behavior vary across different age groups, genders, and experience levels, and what implications does this have for road safety?\nHow can data analytics be used to design targeted driver training programs that address specific behavioral issues?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do external factors like road conditions and traffic congestion influence driver behavior, and how can this information be used to improve road safety?\nHow do weather conditions, such as rain, snow, and fog, affect road safety, and what strategies can be employed to mitigate their impact?\nHow can data science be used to analyze the effectiveness of road safety policies, such as seat belt laws and speed limits, in reducing accidents?\nWhat role does human psychology play in road safety, and how can behavioral insights be used to design safer road systems?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does driver behavior impact fuel efficiency, and how can eco-driving habits be promoted to reduce emissions and fuel consumption?\nHow can driver behavior analysis be used to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban areas?\nHow can driver behavior data be anonymized and protected to ensure privacy while still extracting valuable insights for road safety?"
